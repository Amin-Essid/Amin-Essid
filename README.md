<summary>Early-Stage Startup: From MVP to Market-Ready SaaS</summary>

As a Full Stack Developer at Ziaway, a Canadian startup, I played a key role in rebuilding and launching the platform.<br>

While working with the Ziaway team, I led the revamp of two web applications:
- Ziaway.ca: An AI-powered platform that enables property value evaluation
- Pro-Ziaway: A subscription-based dashboard that provides real estate brokers with access to potential lead data.<br>

**Key contributions:**<br>

- Upgraded the codebase of both web applications from React 16 to React 18, migrating all related packages including Firebase (from namespaced API to modular API) and Redux (to Redux Toolkit).<br>
- Implemented a completely new and modern UI/UX, adding multiple features and pages.<br>
- Developed client and broker dashboards and integrated the applications with our custom machine learning model, enabling users to accurately estimate real estate property values using AI-powered tools<br>
- Integrated multiple third-party APIs and automations, including Stripe (subscription management), Google Maps, Meta, Twilio, and Zoho CRM (marketing campaign monitoring).<br>
- Maintained and developed multiple Node.js cloud functions to handle server-side tasks for Ziaway's web applications.<br>
